# Exam2 Studyguide
Computational Ontologies SoSe2017

## Important Terms/Concepts
* Information Theory (know the basic model of communication over a noisy channel and about Shannon's "bit" as a measurement of information)
* Nyquist frequency / Shannon sampling theorem
* Digital Signal Representation
 * Analog to Digital Conversion
 * Sampling Rate
 * Resolution (Bit-depth)
* Von Neumann Architecture / Harvard Architecture
* The stored program principle
* Moore's Law
* High and Low Level Programming Languages
 * Machine code
 * Assembly language
 * Compiled Languages
 * Compiler
* Theory of memory usage in C
 * heap, stack & data partitions in memory and how they are used

## Electronics
*__Bring your Breadboard and Components to the exam!__*

One problem will ask you to build a circuit on your breadboard from a schematic. All the relevent information from the datasheets will be included on the exam. Bring your breadboards, batteries & battery connectors, jumper wires, ICs, resistors, etc..

* Know how to read a circuit schematic and use a breadboard
* Be able to identify and use components like resistors, transistors, capacitors and integrated circuits.
* Know Ohm's law and how to calculate Voltage, Current, Resistance and Power in a resistive circuit.

## Programming
The largest part of the exam will be on C programs and algorithms:
* be able to understand C code and trace the values of variables through each step of an algorithm written with for and while loops
* be able to modify snippits of code to behave differently, also understand the looping structures while and for well enough to be able to translate between them
* be able to write short programs given the description of a problem or an algorithm written in English

I suggest taking the time to study a few algorithms and get yourself familiarized with their operation and what they look like implemented in a programming language.

Good resources for this!:
* The book Algorithms Unlocked, by Thomas H. Cormen
* geeksforgeeks.org
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/
This is an amazing resource. Mainly you'll want to focus on understanding the Searching and Sorting algorithms. A few I would suggest focusing on are Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort and Quick Sort. Most of them have illustrative videos, but you can also find some nice animations of the algorithms in action on YouTube.

### C Features
You'll be expected to understand and be able to use the various features of basic C. Most of this you'll be able to find in _Beginning C for Arduino_ by Jack Purdum
* Operators
 * Math operators, Boolean operators, assignment operators
* Loops & Control Statements
 * Know how to use if statements, for and while loops. You should know these three command structures like the back of your hand, and be able to use them purposefully in your programs!
* Functions
 * Defining new functions and using them
 * Pass by value and Pass by reference arguments
 * Here is a good exhaustive reference on functions to use as a supplement to Purdum: https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/C_Programming/Functions.html

* Variables
 * Defining and using variables of the basic signed and unsigned types (char, int, byte, float, long, etc..)
 * When and how to use variables at different levels of scope: statement, local, global
* Arrays
 * Defining and using arrays of the basic types
 * Using loops to perform operations on all or some elements of an array
