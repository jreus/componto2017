# Exam2 Studyguide

## Important Terms/Concepts
* Information Theory (know the basic model of communication over a noisy channel and about Shannon's "bit" as a measurement of information)
* Nyquist frequency / Shannon sampling theorem
* Cybernetics
* Von Neumann Architecture / Harvard Architecture
* Compiler
* Assembly Language
* Memory Usage in C (heap, stack, data)
* The stored program principle
* Moore's Law

## Electronics
*__Bring your Breadboard and Components to the exam!__*

One problem will ask you to build a circuit on your breadboard from a schematic. All the relevent information from the datasheets will be included on the exam. Bring your breadboards, batteries & battery connectors, jumper wires, ICs, resistors, etc..

* Know how to read a circuit schematic and use a breadboard
* Be able to identify components like resistors, transistors, capacitors and integrated circuits.
* Know Ohm's law and how to calculate Voltage, Current, Resistance and Power in a resistive circuit.

## Programming
Most of the exam will be focused on programs and algorithms: you'll need to be able to analyze, modify and write short programs.

I suggest taking the time to study a few algorithms and get yourself familiarized with their operation and what they look like implemented in a programming language.

The book Algorithms Unlocked, by Thomas H. Cormen.

This is an amazing resource. I'll be pulling from the Searching and Sorting algorithms. A few I would suggest focusing on are Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort and Quick Sort. Most of them have illustrative videos, but you can also find some nice animations of the algorithms in action on YouTube. 

## C Features
You'll be expected to understand and be able to use the various features of basic C. Including:
* Operators
* Loops & Control Statements
 * Know how to use if statements, for and while loops
* Functions
 * Defining new functions and using them
 * Pass by value and Pass by reference arguments
* Variables
 * Defining and using variables of the basic signed and unsigned types (char, int, byte, float, long, etc..)
 * When and how to use variables at different levels of scope: statement, local, global
* Arrays
 * Defining and using arrays of the basic types
 * Using loops to perform operations on all elements of an array
